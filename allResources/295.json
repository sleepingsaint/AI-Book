            "description": "Multi-label classification involves predicting zero or more class labels. Unlike normal classification tasks where class labels are mutually exclusive, multi-label classification requires specialized machine learning algorithms that support predicting multiple mutually non-exclusive classes or \u201clabels.\u201d Deep learning neural networks are an example of an algorithm that natively supports multi-label classification problems.
