The most popular and de facto standard library in Python for loading and working with image data is Pillow. Pillow is an updated version of the Python Image Library, or PIL, and supports a range [\u2026]",

Generation in EBMs spends more compute to continually refine its answers and doing so can generate samples competitive with GANs at low temperatures, while also having mode coverage guarantees of likelihood-based models. We hope these findings stimulate further research into this promising class of models.",
