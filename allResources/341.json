This January, a preliminary version of AlphaStar challenged two of the world's top players in StarCraft II, one of the most enduring and popular real-time strategy video games of all time. Since then, we have taken on a much greater challenge: playing the full game at a Grandmaster level under professionally approved conditions.",
