This form of deliberative reasoning is essentially \u2018imagination\u2019, it is a distinctly human ability and is a crucial tool in our everyday lives.",

It requires that you take the order of observations into account and that you use models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks that have memory and that can learn any temporal dependence between observations. It is critical to apply LSTMs to learn how [\u2026]",
