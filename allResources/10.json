Previous efforts attempted to build large-scale NIR-VIS face pictures by converting VIS data to NIR images to avoid overfitting.

One of the main problems of GANs is the instability of their training process. A possible method to stabilize the training procedure of a GAN is to add noise to the input data provided to the discriminator model. This solution extends the data distributions of both the generator and the discriminator. At the same time, it prevents the discriminator from",

An examination of facial recognition software in 2018 defined bias as a disparity in the software's performance when applied to people of diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds. To check if a face recognition algorithm is biased, it is most straightforward to train it on a large dataset that includes human faces from various demographics and then observe its results. However, this requires identity-annotated data, which is prohibitively expensive to collect, especially on the massive scale needed to assess a face recognition model. A new",
