In fact, at DeepMind, we now champion a term that perfectly captures my own values and hopes for integrating technology into people\u2019s daily lives: pioneering responsibly. I believe pioneering responsibly should be a priority for anyone working in tech. But I also recognise that it\u2019s especially important when it comes to powerful, widespread technologies like artificial intelligence. AI is arguably the most impactful technology being developed today. It has the potential to benefit humanity in innumerable ways \u2013 from combating climate change to preventing and treating disease. But it\u2019s essential that we account for both its positive and negative downstream impacts.",
