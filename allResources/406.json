            "description": "Your users have questions and you have answers, but you need a better way for your users to ask their questions and get the right answers. They often call your help desk, or post to your support forum, but over time this adds stress and cost to your organization. Could a chat bot add value for your customers? Interestingly, a recent poll shows that 44% of people would rather talk to a chat bot than to a human! In this post we provide a sample solution, called QnABot (pronounced \u201cQ and A Bot\u201d). The QnABot uses Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa to provide a conversational interface for your \u201cQuestions and Answers.\u201d This allows your users to ask their questions and get quick and relevant answers.",

There are still many challenging problems to solve in natural language. Nevertheless, deep learning methods are achieving state-of-the-art results on some specific language problems. It is not just the performance of deep learning models on benchmark problems that is most [\u2026]",
