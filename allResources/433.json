            "description": "A powerful and popular recurrent neural network is the long short-term model network or LSTM. It is widely used because the architecture overcomes the vanishing and exposing gradient problem that plagues all recurrent neural networks, allowing very large and very deep networks to be created. Like other recurrent neural networks, LSTM networks maintain state, and [\u2026]",
