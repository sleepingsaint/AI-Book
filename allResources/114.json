We are interested in shedding light on the quality of their pretrained representations--in particular, if these models can distinguish verbs or they only use the nouns in a given sentence. To do so, we collect a dataset of image-sentence pairs consisting of 447 verbs that are either visual or commonly found in the pretraining data (i.e., the Conceptual Captions dataset). We use this dataset to evaluate the pretrained models in a zero-shot way.",
