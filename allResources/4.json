The goal is to detect instances of objects, such as humans, cars, etc., in digital images. Hundreds of methods have been developed to answer a single question: What objects are where? Traditional methods tried to answer this question by extracting hand-crafted features like edges and corners within the image. Most of these approaches used a sliding-window approach, meaning that they kept checking small parts of the image in different scales to see if any of these parts contained the object they were looking for.

The agent receives a reward from the researchers when its 'positive' actions lead to the desired outcome. An expert-level performance is achieved when the agent modifies actions to maximize a reward. 'Multiagent reinforcement learning' involves multiple agents working together to solve a problem. Things grow more complicated when several cooperative or competitive agents are simultaneously learning. When agents take into account the future actions of their peers and the effects of their actions on those of their peers, the problem quickly becomes too computationally",
