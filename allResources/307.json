            "description": "The scikit-learn Python library for machine learning offers a suite of data transforms for changing the scale and distribution of input data, as well as removing input features (columns). There are many simple data cleaning operations, such as removing outliers and removing columns with few observations, that are often performed manually to the data, requiring [\u2026]",
