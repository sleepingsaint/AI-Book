But as the number (and types) of conversations in Slack that a user follows grows, so does their overall information intake. This may cause users to experience an ever-increasing cognitive burden, which can be distracting and impede deep work. The cognitive load of a user can often increase when they are actively participating in several Slack channels throughout the day while also managing their business.

They must learn a conditional generative model that can capture the multi-modal distribution of human motions in common contexts like text-to-motion synthesis. Due to the wide range of human motions and the various interactions between human body parts, the distribution can be very complex. Due to their excellent capacity to simulate complex distributions, which has been extensively proved in the image generation domain, denoising diffusion models are generative models that are particularly well suited for this task. High test likelihood has frequently demonstrated",

These nonverbal cues improve speech comprehension and establish the communicator's credibility. As a result, teaching the social robot conversational abilities is an essential first step in enabling human-machine contact. To accomplish this, researchers work on co-speech gesture generation, synthesizing audio-coherent human gesture sequences as structural human representations. The target speaker's appearance information, which is essential for human perception, is absent from such a representation. It has been shown that creating real-world subjects in the image domain is highly desirable in audio-driven talking",

The main aim being making user experiences better in fields like human-computer Interactions, visual media art, etc. Holographic displays are a promising alternative that allows precise control and manipulation of the optical wavefront, simplifying the optical setup between the SLM and the human eye. Holographic displays use spatial light modulators (SLMs) and coherent illumination with, for example, lasers. Due to the limitations of the present wavefront modulator technology, holographic displays, in general, have relatively low space-bandwidth products (SBP) directly determined by the SLM's",

While specific MOT standards only consider tracking objects from a small number of pre-defined categories, such as pedestrians and cars, the actual number of types of interest is enormous. Although the recent expansion of MOT to a wide range of categories may appear insignificant, it presents important issues regarding formulating and describing the community's problem. In the same video sequence in Fig. 1, they display the tracking results from two trackers. Tracker A follows the object flawlessly but classifies it slightly incorrectly at",

Recently, the field of artificial intelligence has seen many advances thanks to deep learning and image processing. It is now possible to recognize images or even find objects inside an image. With deep learning, object detection has become very popular with several families of models (R-CNN, YOLO, etc.). However, most of the existing methods in the literature adapt to the training database and fail to generalize when faced with images belonging to different domains. Although most architectures are optimized for well-known benchmarks, significant",
