Understanding how to communicate, interact socially, and control one's emotions while also taking into account the feelings of others can all be aided by practicing imitation. Both humans and animals can mimic the behavior of others, and this form of learning, known as imitation, plays a significant role in how we as humans acquire and refine our cultural practices. While observational learning can occur when the student witnesses an unpleasant behavior and its subsequent consequences and learns to avoid that behavior, imitation learning differs because it requires",

This is why people often use figurative language to express themselves. Figurative language uses idioms, personification, hyperbole, and metaphors to simplify a confusing topic. These figurative expressions are not to be taken literally. Cognitive research has shown that people often visualize a situation based on its textual description. Moreover, humans often tend to unconsciously add some extra information in addition to what is already mentioned in the text to help in tasks like recognizing figurative language and question answering.",

Thanks to modern computers' computing capacity and graphics cards, deep learning has made it possible to achieve results that sometimes exceed those experts give. However, its use in sensitive areas such as medicine or finance causes confidentiality issues. A formal privacy guarantee called differential privacy (DP) prohibits adversaries with access to machine learning models from obtaining data on specific training points. The most common training approach for differential privacy in image recognition is differential private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD). However, the deployment of differential privacy",
