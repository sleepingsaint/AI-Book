            "description": "Existing generative models, such as GAN, VAE, and flow-based models, suffer from mode collapse and must rely on surrogate objectives to approximate maximum likelihood training. Diffusion models have overcome many of these constraints and emerged as a new paradigm for generative models, theoretically supported by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and a score-matching network. The most significant advances have been made in domains that use continuous signals, such as vision and audio. Figure 1 However, extending continuous diffusion models to natural language remains challenging because texts are inherently discrete. Existing efforts begin customizing diffusion models to text in discrete space on unconditional language",
