PCR tests can be used to confirm detection, but PCR tests are not easily available. Hence computation methods to detect monkeypox can be helpful for easy and fast identification of monkeypox in its early stages.\u00a0 Although the human monkeypox disease originates back to ancient times (the 1970s), computer vision-based studies for preliminary disease diagnosis have recently",

            "description": "Over the last few years, video surveillance systems have experienced significant technological and economic expansion. In this context, the person re-identification (Re-ID) emerged. Re-ID is used in several areas, such as security and the study of customer behavior. It became widely used thanks to the performance achieved by deep neural networks. However,\u00a0 the performance decreases for domains other than those in the training data, and its implementation is still difficult in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised domain-adaptive Re-ID is an approach for domain-adaptive learning that uses unlabeled data. This approach first develops a base model using labeled data, including publicly available datasets.",

This is possible because most of the content is almost identical between video frames, as a typical video contains 30 frames per second. The compression algorithm tries to find the residual information between the video frames.\u00a0 Video compression is about finding the sweet spot for the trade-off between the visual quality and the video size.

An estimated 17% of falls in older persons are caused by gait dysfunction, making it one of the most frequent causes of falls. Doctors frequently evaluate patients' ability to walk when they suspect they may have a particular neurological ailment, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease.

AI developments might help the aviation and aerospace sectors to enhance their production methods. The aerospace industry, however, has limited adoption of AI approaches, primarily due to a lack of access to high-quality data, a preference for simple models over complex models, and a need for more competent staff and partners to execute it effectively. However, the proper partner might make AI a revolutionary innovation that impacts aerospace companies'",
