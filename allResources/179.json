Melting Pot assesses generalisation to novel social situations involving both familiar and unfamiliar individuals, and has been designed to test a broad range of social interactions such as: cooperation, competition, deception, reciprocation, trust, stubbornness and so on. Melting Pot offers researchers a set of 21 MARL \u201csubstrates\u201d (multi-agent games) on which to train agents, and over 85 unique test scenarios on which to evaluate these trained agents.",
