A good data governance program guarantees that data is reliable, consistent, and accessible and that its use complies with applicable rules and regulations regarding data protection. In addition to master data management (MDM) projects, it frequently includes data quality improvement initiatives. Organizations can automate several management tasks for a governance program with data governance solutions. Software of this type offers features that facilitate the",
