But I believe the latter is much closer to the truth. AI is already enabling huge leaps in tackling fundamental challenges: from solving protein folding to predicting accurate weather patterns, scientists are increasingly using AI to deduce the rules and principles that underpin highly complex real-world domains - ones they might never have discovered unaided. Advances in AGI research will supercharge society\u2019s ability to tackle and manage climate change - not least because of its urgency but also due to its complex and multifaceted nature.",
