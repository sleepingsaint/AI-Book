            "description": "Regression is a modeling task that involves predicting a numeric value given an input. Linear regression is the standard algorithm for regression that assumes a linear relationship between inputs and the target variable. An extension to linear regression invokes adding penalties to the loss function during training that encourages simpler models that have smaller coefficient [\u2026]",
