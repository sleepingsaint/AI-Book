Though recent research is quite abundant in this field, very few, have been able to produce a robot that is present in the real world and can follow a wide variety of instructions. We are interested in the ability to obey directions given in interactive Language, which entails that the robot can respond skillfully and immediately to new natural language instructions given during current task performance. Recently, researchers at Google research showed a method for creating",

Although this is much faster than what a human can do, it pales in comparison to High-Performance computing solutions, which can perform quadrillions (10^15) of calculations per second. High-Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the aggregation of computing power in ways that provide far more processing power than traditional computers and servers. It involves the ability to perform large-scale calculations to solve complex problems that require processing large amounts of data. A key principle of HPC is the",

From generating videos using text prompts to image editing, we have seen various successful applications of diffusion models in the last quarter.\u00a0 The idea behind the diffusion models is relatively simple. You start with pure noise and gradually denoise until you get a realistic-looking image. You might ask, how about the text prompts we use? How do they affect the output image? Well, the answer is they are used to condition the network so that the gradual denoising process goes in a certain direction. So,",

Additionally, single-task RL agents can largely overfit the tasks they are trained on, rendering them unsuitable for real-world applications. This is where a general agent that can successfully handle various unprecedented tasks and unforeseen difficulties can be useful. The vast majority of general agents are trained using a variety of diverse tasks. Recent deep-learning research has shown",

Large, multi-modal datasets like LAION5B, which contain billions of real image-text pairs, are frequently used to train such models.
