            "description": "In areas with clearly defined reward functions, like games, reinforcement learning (RL) has outperformed human performance. Unfortunately, it is difficult or impossible for many tasks in the real world to design the reward function procedurally. Instead, they must immediately absorb a reward function or policy from user feedback. Furthermore, even when a reward function can be formulated, as in the case of an agent winning a game, the resulting objective may need to be more sparse for RL to solve effectively. Therefore, imitation learning is frequently used to initialize the policy in state-of-the-art results for RL. In this article, they",

Alternatively, modern machine learning (ML) researchers have focused on learning about these types of interactions from data. To explore these learning-based approaches and quickly build agents that can make sense of human instructions and safely perform actions in open-ended conditions, we created a research framework within a video game environment.Today, we\u2019re publishing a paper [INSERT LINK] and collection of videos, showing our early steps in building video game AIs that can understand fuzzy human concepts \u2013 and therefore, can begin to interact with people on their own terms.",

Recent academic work has largely focused on discovering more efficient ways to increase model parameters because the latest technological advancements necessitate more parameters. This increase in model parameters like dataset size and training time has effectively improved the performance of NLP models and computer vision systems. Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a conditional computation technique that activates network components on a per-example basis, is a method that significantly boosts model capacity without proportionally increasing computation. With sparsely-activated MoE models, the number of parameters can be significantly",
