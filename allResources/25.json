            "description": "Large-scale text-conditioned image generation models have shown impressive results in recent years. They can generate realistic-looking images given a text prompt. These models are trained with extremely large image-text caption pairs. Because of the strong semantic prior learned from a huge collection of image-caption pairings, such models may even produce new concepts by combining different compositions. For example, you can ask them to generate \u201cPikachu as a gladiator, riding a horse in space,\u201d and they will produce a relatively realistic image, despite the concept being totally new. Regardless of the new combination, each object instance is known, given the learned",
