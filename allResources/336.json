After playing for Penn State in college, his ambitions were finally realised: the Carolina Panthers drafted him at age 23, and he went on to play for the Chicago Bears and Tennessee Titans, where he broke records as a linebacker. After six years in the NFL, on the cusp of greatness, his performance began to falter. He couldn\u2019t tackle like he once had; his arms slid off the pullup bar. At home, he dropped bags of groceries, and his legs began to buckle underneath him. In 2013 Tim was cut from the Titans but he resolved to make it onto another team. Tim practiced harder than ever, yet his performance continued to decline. Five months later, he finally discovered the reason: he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease). In ALS, the neurons that control a person\u2019s voluntary muscles die, eventually leading to a total loss of control over one\u2019s body. ALS has no known cause, and, as of today, has no cure.",

The agent has one source of information: feedback about unsafe states from a human user.",
