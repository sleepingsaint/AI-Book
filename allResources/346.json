By measuring memory retrieval directly in the brain, neuroscientists have noticed something remarkable: spontaneous recollections, measured directly in the brain, often occur as very fast sequences of multiple memories. These so-called 'replay' sequences play out in a fraction of a second\u2013so fast that we're not necessarily aware of the sequence.",
