Causal influence diagrams (CIDs) are a way to model decision-making situations that allow us to reason about agent incentives. By relating training setups to the incentives that shape agent behaviour, CIDs help illuminate potential risks before training an agent and can inspire better agent designs. But how do we know when a CID is an accurate model of a training setup?",
