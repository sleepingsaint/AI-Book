            "description": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks are one of the most interesting types of deep learning at the moment. They have been used to demonstrate world-class results in complex problem domains such as language translation, automatic image captioning, and text generation. LSTMs are different to multilayer Perceptrons and convolutional neural networks in that they [\u2026]",
