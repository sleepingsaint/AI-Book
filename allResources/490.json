There is no known succesful mechanism for \u201cmass producing\u201d PhDs as is done (in some sense) for undergraduate and masters study.  Here are a few hints that might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own experience.",

            "description": "A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someone\u2019s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  ",

            "description": "Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For instance, if you\u2019re building a speech recognizer, it\u2019s easy enough to get raw speech samples \u2014 just walk around with a microphone \u2014 but labeling even one of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying, you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a regular supervised learning framework.",
