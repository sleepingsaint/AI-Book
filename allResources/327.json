            "description": "Multioutput regression are regression problems that involve predicting two or more numerical values given an input example. An example might be to predict a coordinate given an input, e.g. predicting x and y values. Another example would be multi-step time series forecasting that involves predicting multiple future time series of a given variable. Many machine [\u2026]",
