The application of famous language-image models can be non-trivial for this task since textual descriptions are ambiguous and may not accurately reflect user-desired effects.

Although studies in facial image re-aging have attempted to automate the answer to this issue, the present methodologies could be more effective due to problems including loss of face identity, low resolution, and inconsistent outcomes over many video frames. To demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence in photo-realistically changing footage, Disney researchers have unveiled a revolutionary age-shifting device that",
