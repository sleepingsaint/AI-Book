            "description": "Radius Neighbors Classifier is a classification machine learning algorithm. It is an extension to the k-nearest neighbors algorithm that makes predictions using all examples in the radius of a new example rather than the k-closest neighbors. As such, the radius-based approach to selecting neighbors is more appropriate for sparse data, preventing examples that are far [\u2026]",
