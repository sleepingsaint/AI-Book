Challenging optimization algorithms, such as high-dimensional nonlinear objective problems, may contain multiple local optima in which deterministic optimization algorithms may get stuck. Stochastic optimization algorithms provide an alternative approach that permits less optimal local decisions to be made [\u2026]",
