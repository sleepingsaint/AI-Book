However, because social media texts lack context, they may perform noticeably worse than traditional RE approaches because they are text-based. Textual material is frequently combined with visual content, such as Twitter image postings. It makes sense to include visual material to fill in the gaps when semantic information is lacking to boost performance. Visual-enhanced relation extraction, or MRE as often called, tries to categorize relationships between two entities using visual components. Zheng and colleagues recently",

Our brains create the general impression of coffee from this chemical image. Scientists are just starting to understand how many 400 receptors in our noses can interact with a specific molecule to detect its chemical composition.

Deep neural networks have been successfully exploited to generate many realistic content, such as text, video, music, and image content, as well as transform these contents from one genre to another (X-to-Y generative models). Among the generative models, particular success has been encountered by architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DM). GANs have the benefit of providing a clear statistical objective and are free from normalization issues that plague diffusion models. However, training of GANs remains a difficult task, and models often",
