A diffusion probabilistic model is a class of latent variable models that have arisen to be state-of-the-art on this task. Different models have been proposed lately, like DALLE-2, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, etc., which are surprisingly good at generating hyper-realistic images from a given text prompt. But how are they able to do so? Why are some models better than others in terms of image quality, speed, and reliability? How can we further improve these models? These are some questions the author of the paper has tried to answer.\u00a0 Diffusion probabilistic models",

            "description": "It is okay to assume everybody has heard about the Stable Diffusion or DALL-E at this point. The huge craze about text-to-image models has taken over the entire AI domain in the last couple of months, and we have seen really cool executions.\u00a0 Large-scale language-image (LLI) models have shown extremely pleasing performance in image generation and semantic understanding. They are trained on extremely large datasets (that is where the Large-scale comes from, not the model size) and use advanced image generation methods like auto-encoders or diffusion models.\u00a0 These models can generate impressive-looking images or even videos.

For example, it may be used to automatically detect workers who trip and fall on a construction site or teach a smart home robot to understand a user's gestures. To do this, massive video databases, including footage of people acting naturally, are used to train machine-learning models. However, gathering and labeling millions or billions of movies is costly and time-consuming. The clips sometimes include private data like license plate numbers or the faces of real individuals.

These neural networks offer a method for solving PDEs that complements traditional numerical solvers. Data-driven ML methods, for example, are helpful when observations are noisy or the underlying physical model needs",
