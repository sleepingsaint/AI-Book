In many machine learning systems, agents often have to learn entirely from scratch when faced with new challenges. It\u2019s clear, however, that people learn more efficiently than this: they can combine abilities previously learned. In the same way that a finite dictionary of words can be reassembled into sentences of near infinite meanings, people repurpose and re-combine skills they already possess in order to tackle novel challenges.",
