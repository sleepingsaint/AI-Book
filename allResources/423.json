It can be very difficult to select a good, or even best, transform for a given prediction problem. There are many transforms to choose from and each has a different mathematical intuition.

This struck me as a missed opportunity. While private institutions benefited from the technological advances being driven by university researchers, the subsequent breakthroughs they made were rarely shared for mutual benefit between the two.",
