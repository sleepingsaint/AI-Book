This means that people often turn to mobile devices and interact with applications and systems while multi-tasking. Users might not even touch their mobile device while operating the apps they use, particularly when they are in a vehicle, or when they are actively engaged in another activity. In home environments, this \u201chands-free\u201d capability is facilitated by voice activation systems.\n\nBusiness users now aspire to the same experience in a business environment. They want to operate the applications and systems that they use in their daily work tasks using voice control, just like they do at home. Imagine how much simpler daily work tasks would be. However, adding voice controls to systems has not been easy.\u00a0Voice integration can be a very involved project, even for skilled developers. Moreover, today\u2019s business users want to solve their own tactical and strategic business problems by building \u201clow code/no code\u201d apps. Plus, business users want these apps to follow the same end-user requirements we mentioned earlier: They need to be able to be used on the go anywhere, anytime, hands-free.",
