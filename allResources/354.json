            "description": "Over the last decade, machine learning has made unprecedented progress in areas as diverse as image recognition, self-driving cars and playing complex games like Go. These successes have been largely realised by training deep neural networks with one of two learning paradigms\u2014supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Both paradigms require training signals to be designed by a human and passed to the computer. In the case of supervised learning, these are the \u201ctargets\u201d (such as the correct label for an image); in the case of reinforcement learning, they are the \u201crewards\u201d for successful behaviour (such as getting a high score in an Atari game). The limits of learning are therefore defined by the human trainers.",
