It\u2019s proven to be a good choice - many of our models learn significantly faster, and the built-in features for distributed training have hugely simplified our code. Along the way, we found that the flexibility and adaptiveness of TF lends itself to building higher level frameworks for specific purposes, and we\u2019ve written one for quickly building neural network modules with TF. We are actively developing this codebase, but what we have so far fits our research needs well, and we\u2019re excited to announce that today we are open sourcing it. We call this framework Sonnet.",
