            "description": "Under a microscope, a pane of window glass doesn\u2019t look like a collection of orderly molecules, as a crystal would, but rather a jumble with no discernable structure. Glass is made by starting with a glowing mixture of high-temperature melted sand and minerals. Once cooled, its viscosity (a measure of the friction in the fluid) increases a trillion-fold, and it becomes a solid, resisting tension from stretching or pulling. Yet the molecules in the glass remain in a seemingly disordered state, much like the original molten liquid \u2013 almost as though the disordered liquid state had been flash-frozen in place. The glass transition, then, first appears to be a dramatic arrest in the movement of the glass molecules. Whether this process corresponds to a structural phase transition (as in water freezing, or the superconducting transition) is a major open question in the field. Understanding the nature of the dynamics of glass is fundamental to understanding how the atomic-scale properties define the visible features of many solid materials. In the words of the recently deceased Nobel Prize laureate Philip W. Anderson, whose pioneering work shaped the field of solid-state physics",

There are many clustering algorithms to choose from and no single best clustering algorithm for all cases. Instead, it is a good [\u2026]",
