            "description": "Image and video editing are two of the most popular applications for computer users. With the advent of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), image and video editing have been progressively studied through several neural network architectures. Until very recently, most DL models for image and video editing were supervised and, more specifically, required the training data to contain pairs of input and output data to be used for learning the details of the desired transformation. Lately, end-to-end learning frameworks have been proposed, which require as input only a single image to learn the mapping to the desired edited",

In the investigation of tissue architecture, Hematoxylin, Eosin (H&E), and immunohistochemistry microscopy have long been the method of choice. Furthermore, clinical histopathology continues to be the principal method for diagnosing and treating illnesses like cancer. Classical histology, however, needs to give more molecular data to correctly classify disease genes, analyze development pathways, or identify cell subtypes. It is adequate to identify cell types, assess cell states (quiescent, proliferating, dying, etc.), and",

Different methods are commonly used for object detection to recognize and locate objects, and these algorithms use deep learning to provide relevant outcomes. Deep learning object identification is a quick and accurate method of predicting an object's placement in an image, which may be helpful in various circumstances. Because objects in natural situations are typically oriented upward due to gravity, early research mainly concentrated on horizontal object detection. Oriented bounding boxes are preferred in other contexts, such as aerial pictures, industrial inspection, and scene text.",
