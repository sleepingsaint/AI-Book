            "description": "The demand for chat apps is growing wildly. From social apps to business collaboration, in-game chat to customer support, every app needs chat. Chat apps like Telegram are making mainstream news and generating widespread interest.\r\n\r\nHistorically, building a scalable, feature-rich chat app was surprisingly difficult. Not anymore. PubNub ChatEngine has integrated Amazon machine learning APIs, which makes building intelligent, scalable chat apps super easy for mobile and web.\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, you'll learn how to spin up the PubNub ChatEngine and add Amazon Translate and Amazon Polly for cross-lingual, speech-enabled chat apps that you can embed anywhere.",

These projects are not built by robots. A huge amount of human effort is required to bring them into existence, in addition to the technology used to design, streamline, and improve processes.\r\n\r\nInitiafy makes the workforce element of projects more productive and efficient. Heavy industry projects rely on contractors, with related management challenges of handling documents, health and safety, and quality control. Initiafy provides contractor management on an online platform, giving workers training in a flexible way and ensuring standards are high across a contingent workforce. Initiafy operates in a number of countries, with workers coming from a number of nationalities so it is vital that training is accessible for all workers.",
