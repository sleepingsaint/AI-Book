This segmentation process is an essential but time-consuming step when planning radiotherapy treatment. The findings also show that our system can complete this process in a fraction of the time.",

            "description": "Multi-task learning - allowing a single agent to learn how to solve many different tasks - is a longstanding objective for artificial intelligence research. Recently, there has been a lot of excellent progress, with agents like DQN able to use the same algorithm to learn to play multiple games including Breakout and Pong. These algorithms were used to train individual expert agents for each task. As artificial intelligence research advances to more complex real world domains, building a single general agent - as opposed to multiple expert agents - to learn to perform multiple tasks will be crucial. However, so far, this has proven to be a significant challenge.",
