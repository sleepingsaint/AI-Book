Delivering personalized content for each user as a real-time response is a common goal of these business applications in pursuit of a better customer experience. To that end, information from a user's most recent interaction is frequently used as the primary input for training a model. It best depicts a user's portrait and predicts their interest and future behaviors. Deep learning has dominated recommendation models because the massive amounts of user data are a natural fit for massively data-driven neural models. Online",
