            "description": "With machine learning (ML), more powerful technologies have become available that can automate the task of detecting visual anomalies in a product. However, implementing such ML solutions is time-consuming and expensive because it involves managing and setting up complex infrastructure and having the right ML skills. Furthermore, ML applications need human oversight to ensure accuracy [\u2026]",
