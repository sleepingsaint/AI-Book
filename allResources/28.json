            "description": "Instagram is one of the most happening places on social media, and it is quite important to provide a personalized experience by sending most important notifications to the users. Instagram notifications bridge the communication gap between its users. Avoiding less important content in notifications is very much important to enhance user experience. By prioritizing the quality over quantity approach, engineers at Instagram found ways to send fewer notifications that are more important and interesting to them. A daily digest push notification about stories is a type of notification that lists down stories that are shared and ready to view, and",

Text-to-image generation models that use large-scale training data and model parameters can now vividly depict the visual scene described by a text prompt, allowing anyone to create exquisite images without sophisticated drawing skills. Diffusion models are gaining popularity among image generation approaches due to their ability to generate highly photorealistic images based on text prompts. Text-to-image diffusion models such as LDM, GLIDE, DALL-E 2, and Imagen have demonstrated impressive performance in both text relevance and image fidelity in recent years. Given a text prompt, the models use iterative denoising",

It turns out that the most modern language models, like PaLM, are capable of complex reasoning because they have been trained on millions of lines of code. They demonstrate that current language models are effective at producing code that can control robot behavior in addition to ordinary code. When provided with numerous sample instructions and their accompanying code, language models may take in new instructions and automatically generate new code that reassembles API calls, creates new functions, and expresses feedback loops to",

Monocular depth estimation (MDE), which makes depth predictions using only a single image, can be more useful in particular situations. It is inexpensive, compact, power-efficient, and requires no calibration over its long service life. Due to hardware and software variations, the photographs captured by various cameras look slightly different. To take advantage of a camera's unique aesthetic qualities, an MDE model trained using photos from a single camera could use machine learning. As a result, the model's applicability to photos captured by other cameras is questionable.",

The vast majority of the deep learning libraries listed below, including MongoDB and Google's MapReduce, have been developed in C++. Scylla is a database management system developed in C++ and an alternative to Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB because of its incredibly low latency and high throughput. C++ is the finest language to use when developing large big data frameworks and libraries, dynamic load balancing, and adaptive caching. MongoDB and Google's MapReduce are examples of C++-developed deep-learning libraries included",

            "description": "Time series forecasting, also known as predicting future values based on historical data, is crucial to solving many real-world issues ranging from weather forecasts and anomaly detection to energy usage, system tracking, and monitoring. Due to recent technological advancements with increased access to data and computational power, deep learning (DL) applications are gradually replacing traditional methods when it comes to time series forecasting. In contrast to conventional forecasting techniques, DL models can learn hierarchical representations and more intricate dependencies, reducing the requirement for manual feature engineering and model creation. However, despite their recent success, many real-world applications where live time",
