Let us glance at some of the most cutting-edge Swedish AI startups. Furhat Robotics Social robots have long been associated with science fiction. With the creation of a life-sized robotic face capable of social interactions, Furhat Robotics is making it a reality. The Furhat robot, which can understand natural language in 40 languages and emote in line with the dialogue, functions essentially as a voice assistant with expressions. With a standard face and set of emotions that can be enhanced",

From OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, which generates extremely accurate texts, to its open-source counterpart BLOOM, impressive LLMs have been released one after the other. Previously unsolvable language-related tasks had become merely a challenge for these models. All this advancement is made possible thanks to the massive amount of data we have on the Internet and the availability of powerful GPUs. As good as they sound, training an LLM is an extremely costly process, both in terms of data and hardware requirements. We are talking about AI models with trillions",

            "description": "Continuous-time neural networks are one subset of machine learning systems capable of taking on representation learning for spatiotemporal decision-making tasks. Continuous differential equations are frequently used to depict these models (DEs). Numerical DE solvers, however, limit their expressive potential when used on computers. The scaling and understanding of many natural physical processes, like the dynamics of neural systems, have been severely hampered by this restriction. Inspired by the brains of microscopic creatures, MIT researchers have developed 'liquid' neural networks, a fluid, robust ML model that can learn and adapt to changing situations. These methods can be used in safety-critical tasks",

Transformer designs have shown exceptional performance increases since they were first introduced in 2017, leading to significant advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence. However, the significant computational and memory requirements of their self-attention processes (needed for capturing various syntactic and semantic representations from lengthy input sequences) have restricted their more extensive real-world applicability. In a recent research paper titled 'Transformers with Multiresolution Attention Heads,' researchers suggest MrsFormer, a unique transformer architecture that employs Multiresolution-head Attention (MrsHA) to approximate output sequences.
