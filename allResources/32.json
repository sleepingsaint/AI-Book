Indeed, the creation of artistic images is often not only a time-consuming problem but also requires a significant amount of expertise. If this problem holds for 2D artworks, imagine extending it to dimensions beyond the image plane, such as time (in animated content) or 3D space (with sculptures or virtual environments). This introduces new constraints and challenges, which are addressed by this paper. Previous results involving 2D stylization focus on video contents split frame by frame. The result is that the generated individual frames achieve high-quality stylization but often lead to flickering",

In order to give users a better visual experience, it is vital to understand images' aesthetic and technical quality. IQA uses models to create a link between an image and the user's assessment of its quality. Modern, cutting-edge IQA techniques like NIMA are built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the batch training constraint regarding fixed shape input frequently degrades their performance. The input photographs are typically enlarged and cropped to a set shape to accommodate this, compromising the image quality.",

Given that game developers create games for a variety of platforms, it is imperative. The option between a console and a desktop PC gaming has become obsolete. Instead, users of various mobile and wearable devices\u2014such as smartphones, V.R. headsets, and more\u2014demand immersive gaming experiences. Thanks to AI, developers can now create console-like experiences for several device kinds. AI games come in several formats every year. Some experts argue that the less obvious uses of AI in games are the most potent. AI is becoming more prevalent in",

The formation's lithology, porosity, fluid content, and textural variance determine the digital log responses. The welllogging parameters generate lithofacies groups and facies-by-facies rock property descriptors. Before the introduction of digital logging tools, well-logging data were drawn in curve format on the parameter graph. Well-logging parameter graphs have several drawbacks, including their vast size, abundant memory space, and interference from gridlines. Therefore, it is necessary to translate well-logging parameter graphs into X-Y coordinates, where X stands",

One of the most popular forms of cyberattack is typosquatting, which takes advantage of people's propensity to make typos when typing quickly or to misunderstand words with minor topographical flaws. For the most part, typosquatting involves the construction of malicious websites with URLs that are similar to those of legitimate sites but contain typos (e.g., 'fqcebook' instead of 'facebook' or 'yuube' instead of 'youtube'). If a user accidentally accesses one of these sites, they may unwillingly download malicious software or provide sensitive information to",

Machine Learning(ML), particularly its subfield, Deep Learning, mainly consists of numerous calculations involving Linear Algebra like Matrix Multiplication and Vector Dot Product. AI accelerators are specialized processors designed to accelerate these core ML operations, improve performance and lower the cost of deploying ML-based applications. AI accelerators can significantly reduce the time to train and execute an AI model and perform specific AI tasks that cannot be conducted on a CPU. The main aim of AI accelerators is to minimize power while doing calculations. These accelerators use strategies like optimized memory use and low-precision arithmetic to",
