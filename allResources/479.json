            "description": "One conventional wisdom is that learning algorithms with linear representations are sufficient to solve natural learning  problems.  This conventional wisdom appears unsupported by empirical evidence as far as I can tell.  In nearly all vision, language, robotics, and speech applications I know where machine learning is effectively applied, the approach involves either a linear representation on hand crafted features capturing substantial nonlinearities or learning directly on nonlinear representations.
