            "description": "Picking up a stick and balancing it atop a log or stacking a pebble on a stone may seem like simple \u2014 and quite similar \u2014 actions for a person. However, most robots struggle with handling more than one such task at a time. Manipulating a stick requires a different set of behaviours than stacking stones, never mind piling various dishes on top of one another or assembling furniture. Before we can teach robots how to perform these kinds of tasks, they first need to learn how to interact with a far greater range of objects. As part of DeepMind\u2019s mission and as a step toward making more generalisable and useful robots, we\u2019re exploring how to enable robots to better understand the interactions of objects with diverse geometries.",
