Anyone with ranging from novice to legendary people who can write simple webscrapping scripts to get the metadata. If you are beginning in web scrapping then this will be a great starting point.

Contributions of any kind is appreciated :)

## Heads Up

 Since the project is still in development stage, the site name and hosting address might change frequently. So please refer to this repo untill further updates.

## Release Log

* This project used git large file storage to store log file and database, which was a stupid move from my side. The free credits got used up (24 github actions in single day hence 24 copies in git lfs), so have to find new alternatives. 
* I want to currently discontinue this project because I couldn't find any good solutions, and also I think apart from these few (25 blogs) sources, I need to add a lot more blogs, which I feel like difficult currently because of my office work.
* Currently this project is live again. This time I am using notion db as a backend which also provides searching, sorting, filtering options. The old website won't be updated (atleast untill the next announcement). The access link is provided in the description of readme.

## TODO

- [x] Setup Github actions
- [x] Create a discord channel and send notification for source, resources addition to notion.
- [ ] Add Dynamic Workflow
- [ ] Set concurrent workflows to 1
- [ ] Create a custom frontend using notion backend
- [ ] Add a custom domain for the notion webpage
