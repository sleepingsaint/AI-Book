The crash was attributed to the self-driving cars system not recognizing the difference between a truck and the bright sky above it. The system did not recognize the difference between a truck and the sky?! After you read",

So how does the \"new kid on the block,\" EfficientDet, compare? Without spoilers, we were surprised by these results. NOTE: YOLO v5 has been published after this publication and we have found better results there.",
