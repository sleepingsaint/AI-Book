This time, we will see how to improve the model by data augmentation and especially test time augmentation (TTA). You will learn how to use data augmentation with segmentation masks and what test time augmentation is and how to use it in keras.",

In the TGS Salt Identification Challenge, you are asked to segment salt deposits beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. So we are given a set of seismic images that are $101 \\times 101$ pixels each and each pixel is classified as either salt or sediment.",

We will use a residual LSTM network together with ELMo embeddings, developed at Allen NLP. You will learn how to wrap a tensorflow hub pre-trained model to work with keras. The resulting model with give you state-of-the-art performance on the named entity recognition task.",

By black-box classifiers I mean a classification system where the internal workings are completely hidden from you. A famous example are deep neural nets, in text classification often recurrent or convolutional neural nets.",
