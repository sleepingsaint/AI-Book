One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is \u201ctools to aid a human in using data to do prediction\u201d and the other extreme is \u201ctools to do prediction with no human intervention\u201d.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.",
