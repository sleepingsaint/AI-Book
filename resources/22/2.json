            "description": "When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a \u201cgood paper\u201d looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference\u2014every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?",
