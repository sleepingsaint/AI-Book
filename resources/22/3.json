How do you do it?  As a learning theorist, the first thing you do is pray that this is too much data for the number of parameters\u2014but that\u2019s not the case, there are around 16 billion examples, 16 million parameters, and people really care about a high quality predictor, so subsampling is not a good strategy.",
