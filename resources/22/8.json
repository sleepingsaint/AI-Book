They always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections come to seem reasonable.  Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the topic just isn\u2019t as important as was originally thought.  A few rejections do not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror stories, a great material for conversations.  I\u2019ve decided to share three of mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.",
