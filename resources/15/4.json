However, issuing patches to adjust model behavior after deployment is a significant challenge in deploying and maintaining such models. Because of the distributed nature of the model's representations, when a neural network produces an undesirable output, making a localized update to correct its behavior for a single or small number of inputs is difficult. A large language model trained in 2019 might assign a higher probability to Theresa May than Boris Johnson when prompted. Who is the Prime Minister of",

Feature extraction is the most crucial aspect of image retrieval. The features match the representation of an image and should also make it possible to retrieve the images effectively. Deep Metric Learning (DML) is a technique used to train a neural network to map input images to a lower-dimensional embedding space so that similar images are closer than dissimilar ones. Unfortunately, DML does not resolve background bias which causes irrelevant feature extraction. In the literature,",
