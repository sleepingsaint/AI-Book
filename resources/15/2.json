They train patterns that suppress the objectness scores made by various commonly used detectors and groups. They do this by using standard detection datasets. Through much testing, researchers found how well adversarially trained patches work in both white-box and black-box settings and how well attacks can be transferred between datasets, object classes, and detector models. Lastly, they show a detailed study of physical world attacks using printed posters and clothes worn, and they use different metrics to measure how",

A unique research effort was put into these two segmentation tasks in earlier segmentation systems, which used specialized structures. In a recent attempt to combine semantic and instance segmentation, Kirillov et al. suggested panoptic segmentation, with pixels sorted into discrete segments for objects with well-defined shapes and an amorphous segment for amorphous background areas. However, rather than bringing together the earlier projects, this endeavor produced unique, specialized panoptic structures (see Figure 1a). Recent developments in panoptic topologies",

Most of the objects in both pictures are the same, just you look at them from different angles. In computer vision, objects are assumed to have certain features like edges, corners, etc. Matching these features is critical for some applications. But what would it take to match features between two pictures? Finding correspondence between images is the prerequisite for estimating 3D structure and camera poses in computer vision tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and structure-from-motion (SfM). This is done by matching local features, and",

Most recent state-of-the-art works are either transformer-based or rely on diffusion models. Transformers often compress their spatial representation before learning because the self-attention process scales quadratically with latent space dimensions. Additionally, a transformer flattens the encoded picture tokens to regard images as one-dimensional sequences, which is an unnatural projection of images and necessitates a substantially more",
