Our educators and coaches mostly play this role. These interactions are unique in terms of their characteristics that set them apart from other forms of dialogue. This assessment is also required in the field of Natural Language processing. But, due to its relative freedom and infrequent adherence to rigid rules for computing spelling, syntax, and semantics, natural language input presents significant difficulty for assessment. This field is yet to be researched properly. Recently researchers at google research came up with",

These models enable fine-grained control of the image production process at inference time (e.g., by utilizing text prompts) when combined with a conditioning mechanism. Large, multi-modal datasets like LAION5B, which contain billions of real image-text pairs, are frequently used to train such models. Given the proper pre-training, LDMs can be used for many downstream activities and are sometimes referred to as foundation models (FM). LDMs can be deployed to end users more easily because",

            "description": "Object detection has been an important task in the computer vision domain in recent decades. The goal is to detect instances of objects, such as humans, cars, etc., in digital images. Hundreds of methods have been developed to answer a single question: What objects are where? Traditional methods tried to answer this question by extracting hand-crafted features like edges and corners within the image. Most of these approaches used a sliding-window approach, meaning that they kept checking small parts of the image in different scales to see if any of these parts contained the object they were looking for. This",

The agent receives a reward from the researchers when its 'positive' actions lead to the desired outcome. An expert-level performance is achieved when the agent modifies actions to maximize a reward. 'Multiagent reinforcement learning' involves multiple agents working together to solve a problem. Things grow more complicated when several cooperative or competitive agents are simultaneously learning. When agents take into account the future actions of their peers and the effects of their actions on those of their peers, the problem quickly becomes too computationally",

Unfortunately, it is difficult or impossible for many tasks in the real world to design the reward function procedurally. Instead, they must immediately absorb a reward function or policy from user feedback. Furthermore, even when a reward function can be formulated, as in the case of an agent winning a game, the resulting objective may need to be more sparse for RL to solve effectively. Therefore, imitation learning is frequently used to initialize the policy in state-of-the-art results for RL. In this article, they",
