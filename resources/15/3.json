Deep neural networks have been successfully exploited to generate many realistic content, such as text, video, music, and image content, as well as transform these contents from one genre to another (X-to-Y generative models). Among the generative models, particular success has been encountered by architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DM). GANs have the benefit of providing a clear statistical objective and are free from normalization issues that plague diffusion models. However, training of GANs remains a difficult task, and models often",

            "description": "The field of Data Science and Machine Learning is growing every single day. As new models and algorithms are being proposed with time, these new algorithms and models need enormous data for training and testing. Deep Learning models are gaining so much popularity nowadays, and those models are also data-hungry. Obtaining such a massive amount of data in the context of the different problem statements is quite a hideous, time-consuming, and expensive process. The data is gathered from real-life scenarios, which raises security liabilities and privacy concerns. Most of the data is private and protected by privacy laws and regulations,",

Although realistic digital humans have been produced for films and video games, each character typically requires much artistic time.

The next step after a data scientist completes a model is to deploy it so that it can serve the application. Batch and online model serving are the two main categories. Batch refers to feeding a large amount of data into a model and writing the results to a table, usually as a scheduled operation. You must deploy the model online using an endpoint for applications to send a request to the model and receive a quick response with no latency.",

This question is one such combinatorial issue. As each fold needs to be consistent with flattening, such results are difficult to predict simply by glancing at the design. To answer such questions, the UvA Institute of Physics and the research center AMOLF have shown that researchers may more effectively",
