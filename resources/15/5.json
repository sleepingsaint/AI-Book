Due to recent technological advancements with increased access to data and computational power, deep learning (DL) applications are gradually replacing traditional methods when it comes to time series forecasting. In contrast to conventional forecasting techniques, DL models can learn hierarchical representations and more intricate dependencies, reducing the requirement for manual feature engineering and model creation. However, despite their recent success, many real-world applications where live time",

The most significant advances have been made in domains that use continuous signals, such as vision and audio.
