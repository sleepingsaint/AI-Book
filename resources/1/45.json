            "description": "Just as television transitioned from black and white to color, the web has been moving from a text-based medium to one dominated by sound and vision. Accordingly, content creation has both exploded and changed. Publishers of all types are struggling through this transition as they try to meet the demands of users while keeping their business models intact.\n\nOn-demand audio is attracting significant interest from publishers as mobile listening grows and in-car technology begins to disrupt traditional radio. This trend is most visible in the mainstream adoption of podcasts. But podcasts are just the beginning of a rapidly emerging, and diverse, ecosystem of new digital audio formats. Amazon Echo and advanced text-to-speech services such as Amazon Polly are enabling the creation of these new audio products.\n\nIn this blog post we describe how Spokata leverages these Amazon technologies to make text-based news and information universally accessible as real-time audio.",

            "description": "Users today don\u2019t expect to be tied to a desktop computer. They want to interact with systems on the go, in a variety of ways that are convenient to them. This means that people often turn to mobile devices and interact with applications and systems while multi-tasking. Users might not even touch their mobile device while operating the apps they use, particularly when they are in a vehicle, or when they are actively engaged in another activity. In home environments, this \u201chands-free\u201d capability is facilitated by voice activation systems.\n\nBusiness users now aspire to the same experience in a business environment. They want to operate the applications and systems that they use in their daily work tasks using voice control, just like they do at home. Imagine how much simpler daily work tasks would be. However, adding voice controls to systems has not been easy.\u00a0Voice integration can be a very involved project, even for skilled developers. Moreover, today\u2019s business users want to solve their own tactical and strategic business problems by building \u201clow code/no code\u201d apps. Plus, business users want these apps to follow the same end-user requirements we mentioned earlier: They need to be able to be used on the go anywhere, anytime, hands-free.",
