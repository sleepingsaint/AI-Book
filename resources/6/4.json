These animals roam over vast swaths of land, some migrating thousands of miles across multiple countries following seasonal rainfall. As human encroachment around the region becomes more intense, these species are forced to alter their behaviours in order to survive. Increasing agriculture, poaching, and climate abnormalities contribute to changes in animal behaviours and population dynamics, but these changes have occurred at spatial and temporal scales which are difficult to monitor using traditional research methods. There is a great urgency to understand how these animal communities function as human pressures grow, both in order to understand the dynamics of these last pristine ecosystems, and to formulate effective management plans to conserve and protect the integrity of this unique biodiversity hotspot.",

These findings come alongside a peer-reviewed service evaluation of Streams, our mobile assistant for clinicians, which shows that patient care can be improved, and health care costs reduced, through the use of digital tools. Together, they form the foundation for a transformative advance in medicine, helping to move from reactive to preventative models of care.",

These successes have been largely realised by training deep neural networks with one of two learning paradigms\u2014supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Both paradigms require training signals to be designed by a human and passed to the computer. In the case of supervised learning, these are the \u201ctargets\u201d (such as the correct label for an image); in the case of reinforcement learning, they are the \u201crewards\u201d for successful behaviour (such as getting a high score in an Atari game).

This is a complex, multi-agent environment and one of the canonical 3D first-person multiplayer games. The agents successfully cooperate with both artificial and human teammates, and demonstrate high performance even when trained with reaction times comparable to human players. Furthermore, we show how these methods have managed to scale beyond research Capture the Flag environments to the full game of Quake III Arena.",

Over time, software developers have established a set of best practices for testing and debugging before deployment, but these practices are not suited for modern deep learning systems. Today, the prevailing practice in machine learning is to train a system on a training data set, and then test it on another set. While this reveals the average-case performance of models, it is also crucial to ensure robustness, or acceptably high performance even in the worst case. In this article, we describe three approaches for rigorously identifying and eliminating bugs in learned predictive models: adversarial testing, robust learning, and formal verification.",

            "description": "Multi-task learning - allowing a single agent to learn how to solve many different tasks - is a longstanding objective for artificial intelligence research. Recently, there has been a lot of excellent progress, with agents like DQN able to use the same algorithm to learn to play multiple games including Breakout and Pong. These algorithms were used to train individual expert agents for each task. As artificial intelligence research advances to more complex real world domains, building a single general agent - as opposed to multiple expert agents - to learn to perform multiple tasks will be crucial. However, so far, this has proven to be a significant challenge.",

Building on previous efforts to solve this important feature of general-purpose learning systems, our latest paper sets out an approach for measuring abstract reasoning in learning machines, and reveals some important insights about the nature of generalisation itself.",

That\u2019s why when we launched in February 2016, we did so with an unusual and additional mechanism: a panel of Independent Reviewers, who meet regularly throughout the year to scrutinise our work. This is an innovative approach within tech companies - one that forces us to question not only what we are doing, but how and why we are doing it - and we believe that their robust challenges make us better.",

            "description": "There is more than meets the eye when it comes to how we understand a visual scene: our brains draw on prior knowledge to reason and to make inferences that go far beyond the patterns of light that hit our retinas. For example, when entering a room for the first time, you instantly recognise the items it contains and where they are positioned. If you see three legs of a table, you will infer that there is probably a fourth leg with the same shape and colour hidden from view. Even if you can\u2019t see everything in the room, you\u2019ll likely be able to sketch its layout, or imagine what it looks like from another perspective.",
