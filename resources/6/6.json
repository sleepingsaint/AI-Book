All of these scenarios require you to estimate the likely future reward of your decision. This is tricky because the number of possible scenarios explodes as one peers farther and farther into the future. Understanding how we do this is a major research question in neuroscience, while building systems that can effectively predict rewards is a major focus in AI research.",

We show that the learning rule can be modified so that a program can remember old tasks when learning a new one. This is an important step towards more intelligent programs that are able to learn progressively and adaptively.",

The new notion of sequential social dilemmas allows us to model how rational agents interact, and arrive at more or less cooperative behaviours depending on the nature of the environment and the agents\u2019 cognitive capacity. The research may enable us to better understand and control the behaviour of complex multi-agent systems such as the economy, traffic, and environmental challenges.",

This struck me as a missed opportunity. While private institutions benefited from the technological advances being driven by university researchers, the subsequent breakthroughs they made were rarely shared for mutual benefit between the two.",

To achieve this, we believe we\u2019ll need general-purpose learning systems that are capable of developing their own understanding of a problem from scratch, and of using this to identify patterns and breakthroughs that we might otherwise miss. This is the focus of our long-term research mission at DeepMind.",
