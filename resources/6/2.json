We can take one glance at a complex scene, and within milliseconds be able to parse it into objects and their attributes, like colour or size, and use this information to describe the scene in simple language. Underlying this seemingly effortless ability is a complex computation performed by our visual cortex, which involves taking millions of neural impulses transmitted from the retina and transforming them into a more meaningful form that can be mapped to the simple language description. In order to fully understand how this process works in the brain, we need to figure out both how the semantically meaningful information is represented in the firing of neurons at the end of the visual processing hierarchy, and how such a representation may be learnt from largely untaught experience.",

However, most robots struggle with handling more than one such task at a time. Manipulating a stick requires a different set of behaviours than stacking stones, never mind piling various dishes on top of one another or assembling furniture. Before we can teach robots how to perform these kinds of tasks, they first need to learn how to interact with a far greater range of objects. As part of DeepMind\u2019s mission and as a step toward making more generalisable and useful robots, we\u2019re exploring how to enable robots to better understand the interactions of objects with diverse geometries.",

DNA carries the genetic information that determines everything from eye colour to susceptibility to certain diseases and disorders. The roughly 20,000 sections of DNA in the human body known as genes contain instructions about the amino acid sequence of proteins, which perform numerous essential functions in our cells. Yet these genes make up less than 2% of the genome. The remaining base pairs \u2014 which account for 98% of the 3 billion \u201cletters\u201d in the genome \u2014 are called \u201cnon-coding\u201d and contain less well-understood instructions about when and where genes should be produced or expressed in the human body.

At any moment in the UK, according to one study, one third of the country has talked about the weather in the past hour, reflecting the importance of weather in daily life. Amongst weather phenomena, rain is especially important because of its influence on our everyday decisions. Should I take an umbrella? How should we route vehicles experiencing heavy rain? What safety measures do we take for outdoor events? Will there be a flood? Our latest research and state-of-the-art model advances the science of Precipitation Nowcasting, which is the prediction of rain (and other precipitation phenomena) within the next 1-2 hours. In a paper written in collaboration with the Met Office and published in Nature, we directly tackle this important grand challenge in weather prediction. This collaboration between environmental science and AI focuses on value for decision-makers, opening up new avenues for the nowcasting of rain, and points to the opportunities for AI in supporting our response to the challenges of decision-making in an environment under constant change.",

What\u2019s more, standard architectures are often designed with only one task in mind, often leading engineers to bend over backwards to reshape, distort, or otherwise modify their inputs and outputs in hopes that a standard architecture can learn to handle their problem correctly. Dealing with more than one kind of data, like the sounds and images that make up videos, is even more complicated and usually involves complex, hand-tuned systems built from many different parts, even for simple tasks. As part of DeepMind's mission of solving intelligence to advance science and humanity, we want to build systems that can solve problems that use many types of inputs and outputs, so we began to explore a more general and versatile architecture that can handle all types of data.",

For instance, AlphaZero beat world-champion programs in chess, shogi, and Go after starting out with knowing no more than the basic rules of how to play. Through reinforcement learning (RL), this single system learnt by playing round after round of games through a repetitive process of trial and error. But AlphaZero still trained separately on each game \u2014 unable to simply learn another game or task without repeating the RL process from scratch. The same is true for other successes of RL, such as Atari, Capture the Flag, StarCraft II, Dota 2, and Hide-and-Seek. DeepMind\u2019s mission of solving intelligence to advance science and humanity led us to explore how we could overcome this limitation to create AI agents with more general and adaptive behaviour. Instead of learning one game at a time, these agents would be able to react to completely new conditions and play a whole universe of games and tasks, including ones never seen before.",

            "description": "In this work, we examine what aspects of multimodal transformers \u2013 attention, losses, and pretraining data \u2013 are important in their success at multimodal pretraining. We find that Multimodal attention, where both language and image transformers attend to each other, is crucial for these models\u2019 success. Models with other types of attention (even with more depth or parameters) fail to achieve comparable results to shallower and smaller models with multimodal attention.",

Two years later, its successor - AlphaZero - learned from scratch to master Go, chess and shogi. Now, in a paper in the journal Nature, we describe MuZero, a significant step forward in the pursuit of general-purpose algorithms. MuZero masters Go, chess, shogi and Atari without needing to be told the rules, thanks to its ability to plan winning strategies in unknown environments.",

The diversity of the environment enables interactions involving reasoning about space and object relations, ambiguity of references, containment, construction, support, occlusion, partial observability. We embedded two agents in the Playroom to provide a social dimension for studying joint intentionality, cooperation, communication of private knowledge, and so on.",

They are large complex molecules, made up of chains of amino acids, and what a protein does largely depends on its unique 3D structure. Figuring out what shapes proteins fold into is known as the \u201cprotein-folding problem\u201d, and has stood as a grand challenge in biology for the past 50 years. In a major scientific advance, the latest version of our AI system AlphaFold has been recognised as a solution to this grand challenge by the organisers of the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). This breakthrough demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world.",

            "description": "In an article recently published in Physical Review Research, we show how deep learning can help solve the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics for real-world systems. Not only is this an important fundamental scientific question, but it also could lead to practical uses in the future, allowing researchers to prototype new materials and chemical syntheses in silico before trying to make them in the lab. Today we are also releasing the code from this study so that the computational physics and chemistry communities can build on our work and apply it to a wide range of problems. We\u2019ve developed a new neural network architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network or FermiNet, which is well-suited to modeling the quantum state of large collections of electrons, the fundamental building blocks of chemical bonds. The FermiNet was the first demonstration of deep learning for computing the energy of atoms and molecules from first principles that was accurate enough to be useful, and it remains the most accurate neural network method to date. We hope the tools and ideas developed in our AI research at DeepMind can help solve fundamental problems in the natural sciences, and the FermiNet joins our work on protein folding, glassy dynamics, lattice quantum chromodynamics and many other projects in bringing that vision to life.",

In many machine learning systems, agents often have to learn entirely from scratch when faced with new challenges. It\u2019s clear, however, that people learn more efficiently than this: they can combine abilities previously learned. In the same way that a finite dictionary of words can be reassembled into sentences of near infinite meanings, people repurpose and re-combine skills they already possess in order to tackle novel challenges.",
